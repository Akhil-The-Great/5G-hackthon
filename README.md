# 5G-hackthon
this is a repository for the event on 5G technologies held on 7/2/26
being the only one in my team i am going to do my best in completing this work, my team name is "TheOnlyOne" . the topic of intrest is V2X (vechicle to everything)
the microcontrollert of my choice is esp32 ,i am planning to use its bluetooth and wifi capabilites to make all the systems interconnected. i am planning to have a
traffic signal with trafic mannagement system, a small autonomous vechile and a hub which deals with all the nearby devices (ie) other vechicles. being a beginner coder
the only frnd i can turn to at times of need like this is CHAT GPT. lets see how this goes '_'
my problem statement
Theme 3: Autonomous Vehicle & Drone Systems
PS 3 — Networked Autonomous Navigation & Mission Intelligence
The Big Picture: Drones, delivery bots, autonomous vehicles, and robotic systems
increasingly depend on reliable network connectivity for coordination, telemetry, and
remote control. Build a system that plans, simulates, and manages autonomous
missions while accounting for real-world network variability and environmental constraints.
Core Objectives (Must Demonstrate):
1. Mission planning with constraints — your system must allow users to define
missions (start, end, waypoints, objectives) while respecting constraints (no-fly
zones, battery limits, payload, terrain, or network coverage).
2. Dynamic simulation — the planned mission must execute as an animated realtime simulation showing the vehicle’s state, telemetry, and response to changing
conditions.
3. Adaptability — the system must react intelligently when conditions change
mid-mission (new obstacles, network degradation, weather changes, or competing
objectives).
V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything): simulate vehicles communicating with each
other and with infrastructure (traffic signals, road sensors) to make cooperative
driving decisions.
Live Evaluation — Judges Will:
▶ Define a custom mission and add obstacles mid-flight to test dynamic rerouting.
▶ Stress-test with multiple simultaneous vehicles or tight constraints.
▶ Ask team to explain their path-planning algorithm and decision logic.
Integrate a physical drone, rover, or small robot that mirrors
simulated movements, or use a phone as a “field unit” transmitting real GPS data.
